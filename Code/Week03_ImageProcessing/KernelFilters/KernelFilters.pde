KERNEL FILTERS
Jeff Thompson | 2017 | jeffreythompson.org
 
A filter that looks at its neighbors can be very useful,
since a single pixel in context doesn't tell us a whole lot.
If we weight how much influence the neighboring pixels have,
we call this a "kernel" filter.
 
Kernel filters can be used for lots of things, but they're
often used for things like blurring, which average pixels in
a region, and edge detection (the opposite).

EXAMPLE KERNELS
(These descriptions from the setosa.io link below)
+ blur de-emphasizes differences in adjacent pixels
+ sharpen emphasizes differences in adjacent pixels
+ edge (aka outline) highlights large differences in
  neighboring pixels – pixels of similar intensity will
  be made black, while pixels that differ strongly 
  will be made white

You may also see these, which are variations of the ones above:
+ sobel shows only the differences b/w adjacent pixels
  in a particular direction (up, right, etc)
+ emboss is like sobel, but creates a sense of depth by
  showing differences in both right and bottom directions

More info and some example kernels here:
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)
+ http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/
+ https://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-convmatrix.html
 
CHALLENGES:
+ What happens when you apply a blurring kernel before a
  threshold filter? How is it different than no blur?
+ Try changing the kernel to match some of the ones listed
  in the links above – can you get a simple edge detection 
  working?
+ Our kernel function currently only takes a 3x3 array – can
  you expand it to take any size? Can you have it check to be
  sure the kernel is square and return an error if not?
+ Can you make the kernel interactive, so you can play with
  the values using the mouse or keyboard?
