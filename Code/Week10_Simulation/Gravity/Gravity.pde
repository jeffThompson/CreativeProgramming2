GRAVITY
Jeff Thompson | 2015/20 | www.jeffreythompson.org

Simulating physics can be pretty easy (like this gravity
example) or REALLY complicated. Here we move a ball downward
using gravity and control its "bounciness" with a friction
variable.

For an example with directional movement, see "BouncingBubbles"
in the "Motion" section of the Processing examples.

For REALLY fancy (but complicated) physics, try the Box2D
engine for Processing, explained in Daniel Shiffman's great
book "Nature of Code".

CHALLENGES:
+  Try moving this code to an object-oriented approach, randomly
   adding balls to an ArrayList and dropping them across the screen
   from random X coordinates like bouncing raindrops.
+  Instead of just the bottom of the screen, can you make the ball
   bounce off of a box? What about an ArrayList of balls bouncing 
   off an ArrayList of boxes?

  background(50);
  
  // incrementally adding gravity to the speed
  // makes the ball accelerate
  speed += gravity;
  
  // then add speed to the position
  y += speed;
  
  // bounce!
  // first we set the position of the ball to the 
  // bottom, otherwise it drifts down below the bottom,
  // then we reverse the direction and reduce the speed
  // by multiplying it by "bounciness"
  if (y + dia/2 > height) {
    y = height-dia/2;
    speed *= -bounciness;
  }
