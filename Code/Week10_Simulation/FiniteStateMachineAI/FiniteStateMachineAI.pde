FINITE STATE MACHINE AI
 Jeff Thompson | 2015 | www.jeffreythompson.org
 
 A "finite state machine" or FSM is a way of conceptualizing an 
 entity that has specific and discreet states - in other words, the 
 object can only have one state at a time. With well-chosen states,
 we can create complex-seeming behavior that can mimic physical
 conditions (how the entity moves) or emotional states (angry, curious,
 idle).
 
 For example, we can think of a zombie, but you can substitute the 
 "attack" langauge for any other kind of behavior. Here are some common
 game AI states:
 
   IDLE          just stays still, only aware if something engages it directly
   AWARE         searches for intruders, notices things like open doors
   INTRIGUED     knows something is happening, abandons path to seek
   ALERT         aware of the player and begins hunting them down
   AGGRESSIVE    actively attacking the player
   FLEEING       runs away from the player
   DEAD          no longer aware, but may be revived (depending on the game)
 
 Let's simplify our system a bit. By combining triggers with the resulting
 action, we have what's called a State/Even Table:
   1. idle until player is within a certain range
   2. if within range, moves towards the player
   3. if close enough, attacks
   4. when attack is finished, flee from the player
 
 Implementing this in code is easier than you'd think – we just need
 some if/else statements to control the behavior. This example uses 
 the PVector class, so if you haven't read about that yet, take a look
 at the Processing examples, or the "SeekAndFlee" example here.

 CHALLENGE:
 +  Can you trigger the "flee" state to be triggered when the player
    attacks, maybe by clicking or hitting the spacebar?
 +  Can you give the zombie a better "idle" state? Hint: try "sin()"
 +  Can you make lots of zombies who all "listen" to each other and change
    states based on the state of their neighbor? For example, if one zombie
    is in "seek" mode, all zombies seek to the target. It will likely help
    if you convert this code to an object-oriented approach.
