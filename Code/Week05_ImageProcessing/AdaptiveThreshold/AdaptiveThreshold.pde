ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD
Jeff Thompson | 2017 | jeffreythompson.org

A standard threshold may not work well for all images, especially
if some regions are overall dark or light but contain information.
Instead, an "adaptive" threshold selects which pixels should be
black or white based on a value computed based on neighboring
pixels, giving a much more natural result. Depending on your 
settings, the output can vary from looking like a pen drawing to 
a blown-out old photocopier.
 
CHALLENGES:
+ Another method (described in the first link below), suggests
  finding the min/max values for the neighboring region and
  using (min+max)/2 as the threshold. Can you implement that
  in our function below? How do the results differ?
