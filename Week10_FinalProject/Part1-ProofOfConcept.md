# PART 1: PROOF OF CONCEPT  

### TLDR  
* Due April 13  
* Create a proof of concept for your project  
* Upload at least one screenshot to Canvas

### CREATE A PROOF OF CONCEPT  
Rather than write a proposal, pitch, or other document, we'll start this project with a proof of concept. The goal this week should be rough code that demonstrates your project's main idea and functionality. This is kind of like the MVP document you created for our last assignment: something that shows us what you want to do, what we'll experience, and will help you think through what you need to do to realize the project.

Don't worry too much yet about visual details, getting everything exactly right, etc. Instead, try to get the most important parts of the project present and working (or working-ish, it's ok if they're glitchy or broken). If your project has lots of parts, try to implement the biggest, most important one now â€“ you can always add details and refine things later!

Some examples:  
* *I want to make a tile-based RPG*: a `Tile` class that draws the level, a player that can move around but no actual gameplay yet  
* *I'll make a generative zine*: generate some visuals that are related to the project's aesthetic, figure out `SVG` export  
* *I'd like to use skeleton tracking cmobined with dance*: get the tracking to work, make a couple of sketches exploring possible visuals resulting from that data  
* *I don't know exactly the format, but I'm interested in XXX, YYY, and ZZZ*: it's totally ok to work intuitively! Use this week to prototype various directions the work could take  

Overall the goal should be "show, not tell." Think of this as a project proposal but in the form of making stuff. Show us what's possible, what you're excited about, and give us a glimpse into what you plan to make. You can verbally fill in the gaps, but we should get a pretty good sense from what you show us.

### TURNING EVERYTHING IN  
When you're done, take at least one screenshot of your project-in-progress and turn it in to Canvas. We'll take a look together next week, then dig into the pen plotter for an in-class project over the next two weeks.
