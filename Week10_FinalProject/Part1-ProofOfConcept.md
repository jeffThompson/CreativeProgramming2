# PART 1: PROOF OF CONCEPT  

### TLDR  
* ⚠️ Due Thursday, April 29 by 11am EST ⚠️
* [Create a proof of concept for your project](#create-a-proof-of-concept)  
* [Upload at least one screenshot to Canvas](#turning-everything-in)

### CREATE A PROOF OF CONCEPT  
Rather than write a proposal, project pitch, or other document, we'll start this project with a proof of concept. The goal this week should be rough code that demonstrates your project's main idea and functionality. This is kind of like the MVP document you created for our last assignment: something that shows us what you want to do, what we'll experience, and will help you think through what you need to do to realize the project.

Don't worry too much yet about visual details, getting everything exactly right, etc. Instead, try to get the most important parts of the project present and working (or working-ish, it's ok if they're glitchy or broken). If your project has lots of parts, try to implement the big, important ones now – you can always add details and refine things later!

### TURNING EVERYTHING IN  
When you're done, take at least one screenshot of your project-in-progress and turn it in to Canvas. We'll take a look together next week, then have demos (based on your interests), one-on-one meetings, and work time.
