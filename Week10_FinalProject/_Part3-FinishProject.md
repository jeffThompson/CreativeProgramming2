# PART 3: FINISH PROJECT

### TLDR  
* ⚠️ Due for critique Monday, May 17 by 1pm EST ⚠️  
* Documentation due by Tuesday, May 18 by 9am

### FINISH YOUR PROJECT  
**Note! Our final critique is scheduled for Monday, May 17 from 1–4pm EST.** We'll meet then to look at your work (and the work of CP3) using the critique Zoom link on Canvas.

Not much to say here: finish your project! Be as picky and detail-oriented as possible: color, placement, motion, flow, presentation, typography... everything should be considered and feel like it forms a cohesive whole. The aim of this project is something that combines the skills you've learned in this class with your own interests and professional goals, so apply the same rigor that you might for a client or public exhibition.

### TURN IN DOCUMENTATION TO CANVAS  
The last step for your projects is to turn in documentation to Canvas. This process can be a pain but is so necessary for a piece to really be complete: it's what goes in your portfolio, what the world sees (most of the time), and is an important creative muscle to develop.

The format of your documentation is up to you but will be a part of the overall grade for your project. This might include any of the items below or a combination:  

* Screen recording of your piece running  
* Exported frames, edited into a video  
* Screenshots  
* Photographs of physical works (or video, for performances)
* Github repo with detailed `readme` file  
* Project blog post with images, code explanation  

When you have your documentation together, please either upload your files to Canvas or post a link to where I can find it.

**Note! If you have any other unfinished assignments, they need to be turned in by that time too.** Anything submitted after that will not be accepted, sorry.
