# PART 3: WIP

### TLDR  
* Due April 27  
* Continue working on your project  
* Nothing to turn in on Canvas  

***

### CONTINUE WORKING  
This week, you should continue to make significant progress on your project. Now is a great time to test out possible directions for your project, figure out thorny technical stuff, and build a solid foundation. Think about this like outlining a paper: with that in hand, all you need to do is connect the dots and make everything nice!

Next week is our last regular class together: we'll have a studio day for you to work on stuff and get help. I will be available between then and the final crit, but next week will be an important time for you to get help. Think about the big-picture things that you input on or assistance with: structural things in your code, setting up a class, output format, etc.

No need to turn in anything to Canvas this week. Please come to class ready to work!
