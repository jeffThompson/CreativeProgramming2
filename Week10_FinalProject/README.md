### ASSIGNMENT   
Our last project of the semester is meant to be a culmination of the two Creative Programming courses you've taken: make an art/design project that uses code, one that puts the technical and creative skills you've gained to work, that explores an idea or approach that you're excited about, and that is polished and (hopefully) ready for your portfolio. Think about the past projects we've done and the ways of working that resonate with you. This can be a client-driven piece, a poetic- or conceptually-focused fine art project, a tool, or somewhere in between or entirely different!

Think ambitiously about what you want to make and see in the world. What formats and processes excite you? What ideas or visuals do you want to explore? What do you want your audience to get from your work? What parts of writing and making with code do you find most rewarding? You're also encouraged to think about ways of getting out of the screen: prints, sculpture, performance, books/zines, etc!

You don't have to use `p5.js` for this, but I may not be able to help much if you use a tool I don't have experience with. Please chat with me early on if you want to work with another tool/language so we can talk about the ways I can support your project.

### EXTRA TUTORIALS  
We won't have any more formal tutorials this semester, since everyone's projects will be going in different directions. However, I'm very happy to demo stuff for you all based on your interests!

Are there parts of `p5.js` or Javascript that we haven't covered that you want to know more about? Or things you want to do with code but don't know how to do? Other languages or output formats you want to try out? Be sure to let me know and we can take a look together!
