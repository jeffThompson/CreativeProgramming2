### REFINED PITCH  
Having received feedback on your early proof-of-concept, and having spent some time further ideating in class, please spend some time this week writing up a short, refined project pitch. Think of this as the next stage after chatting with a client or a curator: you know your idea has legs, now what are you going to make?

Your pitch can vary in style and content, but should at least include:  

* **WHAT:** 1â€“2 paragraphs painting a visual picture of what your project will be. Avoid broad statements like "I'm going to make a game" and instead get into the details! What is the settings, who is the player, what are the core mechanics?  
* **TIMELINE:** give us a week-by-week description of what you need to complete for the project  
* **CHALLENGES:** list at least three technical or other challenges that you envision dealing with. These can be simple ("how can I get microphone input?") or really thorny ("how do I load 10k images without breaking my computer?")  

***

### WIP  
This week (and next week too) your assingment is simple: keep working on your project! The details will vary depending on what you're working on, so use your timeline as a guide and try to keep focused on getting the big-picture parts done first before diving into little details. You should have something concrete you can share with the group next week.

We'll have studio time for the next few weeks, so keep a running list of stuff you know you'll need help with or want feedback on.
