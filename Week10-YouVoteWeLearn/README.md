# YOU VOTE, WE LEARN: GAMES!

### TLDR  
* Due April 25  
  * For April 18: prototype of your game    
  * For April 25: finished version of your game ready for us to uplay  
    * Upload using CyberDuck  
    * Turn in a link on Canvas  
    * Write final project proposal  
* Create a game with `p5.js`!  
  * We'll publish them online for everyone to play  

***

### ASSIGNMENT  
As our last regular assignment before the final project, you voted and we're going to learn to make games! (We'll also do some HTML/CSS in class before the final crit.) Javascript is great for 2D games: it handles graphics really well, you can play them anywhere, and we can learn some cool physics and even AI stuff. We do have to code everything ourselves, so topics like collision detection can be challenging, and games like platformers will probably be too hard for this quick project.

We'll play some classic arcade games together, then emulate them in `p5.js`. We'll also review object-oriented programming, then you can either create your own game or modify an existing game into a totally new state! Feel free to incorporate graphics, sound, and sprites if you want. Controls can range from keyboard and mouse to the webcam too!

### FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 18  
This week, please start prototyping your game. You should aim for a really rough but playable prototype, rather than polished graphics. Think about the "minimum viable product" discussion we had in class: what are the necessary elements for your game and what are stretch goals? What classes might you need to create for the objects in your game?

We'll take a look at your work in progress next week, then go over a bit of game AI and have studio time for you to work on your game.

### FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 25  
For next week, please finish your game and upload it using CyberDuck! We'll play your games next week and start ideating your final project.

Keep in mind the idea of an MVP document we talked about last week: what has to happen first to make your game playable and what are things you can add later to make it more visually interesting or fun to play? 

If you do find yourself with extra time, you could try adding...  
* Sound effects or music (extra bonus: record your own!)  
* Sprites or other graphics  
* Intro screen  
* Recording high scores (super bonus: keep track using [web storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)!)  

When done, upload a link to your game to Canvas.

### INSPIRATION  
* The games we played (and built) in class: [*Pong*](https://www.ponggame.org) and [*Asteroids*](https://freeasteroids.org)  
* Other classic games like [*Galaga*](https://www.classicgamesarcade.com/game/21637/galaga.html), [*Frogger*](https://www.classicgamesarcade.com/game/21607/frogger.html), or *Breakout*  
* Or more recent but buildable games like *Flappy Bird*    
* Nick Montfort's amazing book *Racing the Beam* (`PDF` in the `Readings` folder)
