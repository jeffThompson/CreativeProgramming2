# YOU VOTE, WE LEARN: GAMES!

### TLDR  
* Due April 25  
  * For April 18: prototype of your game    
  * For April 25: finished version of your game, ready for us to upload and play  
* Create a game with `p5.js`!  
  * We'll publish them online for everyone to play  
  * And start thinking about your final project

### ASSIGNMENT  
As our last regular assignment before the final project, you voted and we're going to learn to make games! (We'll also do some HTML/CSS in class before the final crit.) Javascript is great for 2D games: it handles graphics really well, you can play them anywhere, and we can learn some cool physics and even AI stuff. We do have to code everything ourselves, so topics like collision detection can be challenging, and games like platformers will probably be too hard for this quick project.

We'll play some classic arcade games together, then emulate them in `p5.js`. We'll also review object-oriented programming, then you can either create your own game or modify an existing game into a totally new state! Feel free to incorporate graphics, sound, and sprites if you want. Controls can range from keyboard and mouse to the webcam too!

### FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 18  
This week, please start prototyping your game. You should aim for a really rough but playable prototype, rather than polished graphics. Think about the "minimum viable product" discussion we had in class: what are the necessary elements for your game and what are stretch goals? What classes might you need to create for the objects in your game?

We'll take a look at your work in progress next week, then go over a bit of game AI and have studio time for you to work on your game.
