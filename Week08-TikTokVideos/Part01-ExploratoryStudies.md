# PART 1: EXPLORATORY STUDIES

### TLDR

* Due March 28  
* Set up a template that matches Instagram reels/TikTok posts  
* Create 2 (or more) different filter systems  
* Process some still images and save the results  
  * Upload the output to Canvas (1 image per filter)  
  * Bonus: add video support, if you have time  
* Write down 1â€“2 things you might like to learn in the next section

### PROJECT TEMPLATE  
In order to create projects for specific platforms, a good first step is to find the ideal format and understand the restrictions that platform has. Usually Googling `Instagram reels format 2023` will get you an article with up-to-date info. I've put together some basics for you to get started:

* Instagram reels:  
  * Dimensions: `1080x1920 pixels`  
  * Safe zone: `250 pixels` at the bottom for UI elements  
* TikTok:  
  * Dimensions: `1080x1920 pixels`  
  * Safe zone: more complicated ðŸ˜œ
* (We'll add a UI overlay next week to complete the look!)  

With this info and the list of other elements we came up with in class, you'll want to first create a template in code. This should include all the relevant parts (loading media, a function to process the frame, etc) you'll need.

### CREATE TWO (OR MORE) FILTERS  

With your template ready, the main thing you should work on this week is creating two or more image filters! The goal here is exploratory: what cool things can you come up with? Think about what we covered in class and how you could use the idea of pixel access to turn images (and, next week, videos) into something new and surprising.

When you're happy with your filters, run an image through them. Save one image for each and upload the output to Canvas.

### WHAT DO YOU WANT TO LEARN NEXT?  
When we finish this project, our last regular section together before the final is open-ended: what do you want to learn?

Possible topics include:  
* Games in `p5.js`  
* Simulating natural systems  
* Web design with HTML/CSS  
* 3D in Javascript  
* Web scraping  
* API data (weather app?)
* Generative text/poetry in Python  

Please write down at least 1â€“2 topics you'd be interested in. We'll do ranked-choice voting next week to decide what we do next!
