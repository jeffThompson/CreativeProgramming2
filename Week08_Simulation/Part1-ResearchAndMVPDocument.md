# PART 1: RESEARCH AND MVP DOCUMENT  

### TLDR  
* ⚠️ Due Thursday, April 8 by 11am EST ⚠️
* [Research your chosen system and create at least 10 detailed sketches](#research-your-chosen-system)  
* [Create an MVP document with stretch goals](#create-an-mvp-document)  
* [Turning everything in](#turning-everything-in)

### Research your chosen system  

For next week, pick the natural system you'd like to research and observe. Reading will be useful, but equally important is looking. You should ideally pick a system that you can observe in real life but if you can't, watch videos on YouTube etc in the same way you would in person. You should also research your topic (Wikipedia and its "related articles" is a great place to start), taking careful notes on anything that seems interesting or helpful. Follow links in Wikipedia articles too – rabbit holes of knowledge are super productive for this kind of work.

As you're working, create at least 10 sketches of the different parts of your system. These should be as detailed as possible and can include annotations, arrows, etc. The goal is an understanding that goes beyond the superficial, allowing you later to translate these things into code. Be as specific as possible!

### Create an MVP document  

Having researched your natural system, you should write up a *Minimum Viable Product* (MVP) document. MVPs are part of the [Agile development approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). As you might suspect, they describe the most basic version of your project: what, at a minimum, it needs to be "viable" or finished. This might seem overly-simple, but it can be really helpful. An MVP articulates what you need to do first and helps avoid getting distracted by fun features at the expense of the core of your project. 

We won't be following the format of MVPs as they are used for app or product development. Instead, you can think of this as a to-do list. What is the core functionality, features, and visual elements your project needs?

For example, if we were building a snowfall simulator, our MVP might list:  
* Generate various snowflake shapes algorithmically  
* Create realistic falling motion  
* Respawn snowflakes when they hit the bottom of the screen  
* Wind changes the direction of snowfall  

You can also list "stretch goals," elements you want to add if time allows:  
* Physics applied to larger/smaller snowflakes  
* Let snowflakes pile up on the ground  

A good MVP becomes a to-do list *and* is kind of like an outline for your code! Write up your MVP in list-form, like above but in as much detail as you can.

### Turning everything in  

When done, photograph all your sketches (if you're working analog) and add them as a section in your MVP document. Tidy everything up and arrange it so it feels cohesive, then save as a `PDF` and upload to Canvas.
