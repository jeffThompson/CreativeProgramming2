### REQUIRED MATERIALS
Required and suggested readings will be provided as PDFs on GitHub – there is no required textbook.

* A reliable webcam, either built into your computer or an external one. You may want to consider purchasing an external webcam for class projects anyway. I suggest the Logitech C920 (though at $80 it’s kinda spendy). Logitech also offers their BRIO camera, which does 4k video (but is $200). For a barebones but manual focus model, the ELP camera is a good choice though the picture quality is not as good.
* A notebook or sketchbook for taking notes, figuring things out, and ideation.

### FORMAT  
Our class time will be spent together critiquing your homework projects, covering technical material, introducing new assignments, looking at examples, group ideation and feedback exercises, and work time.

Because we will cover a lot of material this semester and because this course will be both rigorous and thorough, it’s really important that you stay on top of your coursework.

> :warning: Don't hestitate to reach out if you have any questions at all! Better to ask a question than be unsure of something

Attendance will be taken at the start of class every week. You are allowed two absences per semester to use at your discretion – each additional absence will result in your final grade being lowered by 1⁄2-letter. Late arrivals will be marked tardy, with 3 tardies equaling one absence. The only exception is severe illness – if this is the case, please let me know as soon as possible and we can work something out.

### HOMEWORK
Homework in this class is meant to be exploratory, a way to expand on the experiences and ideas in class. But, unlike studying for tests, projects require considerable engagement and thoughtful work on your own. I encourage wide-ranging interpretation of assignments: consider ways that you can complete the project that are creatively and intellectually exciting for you, not fulfilling the basic requirements. (That said, some assignments will have restrictions on them – these kinds of constraints can spur creativity, so embrace them!) 

Details of projects will be available on the class Github page (see link on the first page of this syllabus) including how to turn them in, what’s to be included, etc.

### GRADING
The goal of all assignments is for you to think and make. Everyone comes from different backgrounds and experience, so I’ll be looking for improvement, curiosity, engagement, and a willingness to experiment more than mastery of a technical skill or idea. However, as an intermediate-level class, I expect you to dive in, take on challenges, and push your skills and your work. A grading rubric will be provided with each assignment to help you understand what is expected and how well you did.

Final grades will be determined as follows:

* Homework: 70%
* Class participation: 15%
* Final project: 15%

### LEARNING ACCOMMODATIONS
The goal of this class is for everyone to succeed. Stevens and the VA&T program are dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The Office of Disability Services (ODS) works with undergraduate and graduate students with learning disabilities, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, psychiatric disorders, and other such disabilities in order to help students achieve their academic and personal potential. They facilitate equal access to the educational programs and opportunities offered at Stevens and coordinate reasonable accommodations for eligible students. These services are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy with support from the ODS staff. The ODS staff will facilitate the provision of accommodations on a case-by-case basis. 

If you have any questions about learning accommodations, please don’t hesitate to talk with me during or outside of class.

### PRONOUNS
As this course includes lots of interaction between students, it’s important for us to create an environment of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronouns and chosen name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or pronouns, please inform me of the necessary changes.

Note! You can also go to Edit Profile on Zoom and change your display name and add pronouns. If your professor has enabled it, you can also change your display name during a meeting by clicking the little dot-thing next to your video.

### INCLUSION STATEMENT
Stevens and the VA&T program believe that diversity and inclusiveness are essential to excellence in academic discourse and creativity. In this class, the perspective of people of all races, ethnicities, gender expressions and gender identities, religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities will be respected and viewed as a resource and benefit throughout the semester. Suggestions to further diversify class materials and assignments are encouraged. If any course meetings conflict with your religious events, please do not hesitate to reach out to me to make alternative arrangements.
