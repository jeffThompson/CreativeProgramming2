# IMAGE FILTERS

### TLDR  
* Due Feb 23  
* Create an image filter, focusing on pixel manipulation  
* Formatted for Instagram stories and/or TikTok  
  * Add UI overlay on top of your output images  
* Feb 16: three variations for feedback  
* Feb 23: finish project, upload three images manipulated by your filter to Canvas  
* No need to turn in code for this project

### ASSIGNMENT  
In 1990, Adobe released version 1.0 of Photoshop, a new image-manipulation software that would become so ubiquitous that its name would is used as a verb. In that first official release, Photoshop included filters, algorithms that could go beyond adjusting a photograph and do fun things like blur and image or make it look like a pencil drawing. (Or you could just [run all of the filters](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/19616/every-photoshop-filter) on one image.) Later, platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and Tiktok would employ more complex filters to make a photo look vintage, smoosh your face, and make super weird images with [slit scanning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit-scan_photography). This week, we'll explore images "under the hood," looking at how to view  the pixel values of an image, then find creative ways to manipulate those pixels to make our own filters.

For this project, your assignment is to create the weirdest, most interesting, far-out filter you can! These should be designed to work with still images for Instagram stories and/or TikTok. It should load an image, do something interesting using its pixels, and save the result. While you can definitely get inspired by existing filters, you should focus on creating something that's your own. Try to work in an exploratory way: experiment and see what starts to emerge! Feel free to add other elements if you want, but the main focus of the project should be on pixel-level manipulation.

### PROJECT TEMPLATE  
In order to create projects for specific platforms, a good first step is to find the ideal format and understand the restrictions that platform has. Usually Googling "Instagram story format 2022" will get you an article with up-to-date info. I've put together some basics for you to get started:

* Instagram story:  
  * Dimensions: `1080x1920 pixels`  
  * Safe zone: `250 pixels` at the bottom for UI elements  
* TikTok:  
  * Dimensions: `1080x1920 pixels`  
  * Safe zone: more complicated ðŸ˜œ

It would also be common to add sample UI on top of your images, so that clients and others can see your work in context. The quickest way to do this would be to buy a PNG or Illustrator overlay or take an hour or two and make one yourself â€“ I've gone ahead and made them for you! You can find them in the `Resources` folder, including the Illustrator file they were made with so you can modify the text, add profile images, etc. Of course, if you want the challenge, go ahead and make them yourself from scratch!

### RESOURCES  
* PDF of *The Pocket Handbook of Image Processing Algorithms in C* by Harley Mylser and Arthur Weeks in the `Readings` folder â€“ not super easy to read but a great resource (Ling Dong has created an [amazing port of this book to Processing!](https://github.com/LingDong-/Processing-Demos-for-The-Pocket-Handbook-of-Image-Processing-Algorithms))  
* For a deep, mathy take, see [*An Interdisciplinary Introduction to Image Processing: Pixels, Numbers, and Programs*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/interdisciplinary-introduction-image-processing) by Steven L. Tanimoto  
* [Interesting video on computational photography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIbeiddq_CQ) from Nat and Friends  
* [More image filter tutorials](https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-image/Filters/index.html) from Crystal Chen and Paolla Bruno Dutra  
* You can [view the source code of the original Photoshop release](https://web.archive.org/web/20140507131754/http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/adobe-photoshop-source-code/)  
* Scientific imaging software can be great, both for processing images and for getting ideas: [Fiji, the GUI version of ImageJ](https://fiji.sc/), is a good place to start
