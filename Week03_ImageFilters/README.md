# IMAGE FILTERS

**DUE MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17**  

In 1990, Adobe released version 1.0 of Photoshop, a piece of image-manipulation software that would become to ubiquitous that its name would even become a verb. In that first official release, Photoshop included a variety of tools for changing an image such as brightness and contrast adjustments. It also included filters, more complex algorithms that could do fun things like blur and image or make it look like a pencil drawing. (Or you could just [run all of the filters](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/19616/every-photoshop-filter) on one image.) Later, platforms like Instagram and Snapchat would employ more complex filters, like giving you animated dog ears (which involves computer vision and facial recognition – stuff we'll cover in a few weeks!) This week, we'll start simple, exploring "under the hood" of images. First, we'll see how to view the pixel values of an image, then find creative ways to manipulate those pixels to make our own filters. 

Your assignment this week is to create a filter of some kind in Processing. It should load an image, do something interesting to its pixels, and save the result. While you can definitely get inspired by existing filters, I want you to focus on creating something of your own. You might have an idea of what you want to do and code it, but more likely you should just start experimenting and see what starts to emerge!

## DELIVERABLES  
To turn in the project, please upload the following files to Canvas:  
* 3 images processed by your sketch (these can be with different settings in your code, if you want)  


## STRETCH GOALS  
1. Can you make your sketch interactive, allowing you to change parameters with the mouse/keyboard and save the result when you're done?  
2. Try using the [`selectInput()` command](https://processing.org/reference/selectInput_.html) to open a file browser!  


## FOR MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17  
For next week, create a filter you're excited about and process three different images with it, saving each to file. If you want, you can use the data from two or more images within your sketch, merging them in interesting ways. When you're done, upload the files to Canvas.

Try to work in an exploratory way: you're not tasked with solving a problem or to re-create something: instead, see this as a chance to make the weirdest, more interesting image you can!


## RESOURCES/GOING FURTHER  
* In this week's `Readings` folder, there is a PDF of Harley Mylser and Arthur Weeks' *The Pocket Handbook of Image Processing Algorithms in C* – not super easy to read but a great resource for seeing how common image processing tasks is accomplished  
* You can [view the source code of the original Photoshop release](https://web.archive.org/web/20140507131754/http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/adobe-photoshop-source-code/)  
* Scientific imaging software can be great, both for processing images and for getting ideas: [Fiji, the GUI version of ImageJ](https://fiji.sc/), is a good place to start
