COURSE POLICIES
====

For all policies, course description, and calendar, see the [Syllabus](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming2/blob/master/Syllabus.pdf).

## ATTENDANCE  
Because this class will cover so much technical material, and because our process of experimentation and critique is collaborative, attendance is mandatory. You are allowed two absences per semester to use at your discretion – each additional absence will result in your final grade being lowered by ½-letter. Late arrivals will be marked tardy, with 3 tardies equaling one absence. The only exception is severe illness – if this is the case, please let me know as soon as possible and provide a doctor’s note documenting your illness.

## HOMEWORK  
Homework in this class is meant to be exploratory, a way to expand on the experiences and ideas in class. I encourage wide-ranging interpretation of assignments: consider ways that you can complete the project that are creatively and intellectually exciting for you, not fulfilling the basic requirements. (That said, some assignments will have restrictions on them – these kinds of constraints can spur creativity, so embrace them!) Because this is an intermediate class, you should be pushing your work further: creatively, technically, and conceptually. 

Unlike tests, projects require considerable engagement and thoughtful work on your own, and I want to see you working each week on projects. All assignments are due by the start of class and should be turned in on Canvas – late projects will be marked down 10 points for each week they are late. Details of projects will be available on the class GitHub page (see link on the first page of this syllabus) including details about how to turn in specific projects, what’s to be included, etc.

You will have 24/7 access to the Lab and Studio, and use of the Fab Lab during open hours for printing and equipment checkout.

## GRADING  
The goal of all assignments is for you to think and make. Everyone comes from a different background and experience, so I’ll be looking for improvement, curiosity, engagement, and a willingness to experiment. A grading rubric will be provided with each assignment to help you understand what is expected and how you did.

To get a C (an average grade) you should:  

* Put time into your projects each week  
* Complete everything on time  
* Participate in critiques and discussions  

For a B or an A, you should additionally:

* Take risks and try things enthusiastically  
* Be an active and unsolicited participant in critiques and discussions  
* Take assignments beyond their minimum requirements  

Final grades will be determined as follows:  

* Homework: 60%  
* Class participation: 25%  
* Final project: 15%  
 
## REQUIRED MATERIALS  
Required and suggested readings will be provided as PDFs on GitHub – there is no required textbook.

* Laptop capable of running class projects and code, power charger, and reliable internet connection – bring every week, please!  
* External webcam, if your laptop doesn’t have one built in (or it doesn’t work). You may want to purchase an external one for class projects anyway, though we’ll talk more about cameras in a few weeks, so don’t get one now unless yours is broken.  
* We will be using only free software during the semester: Chrome and Javascript, Processing, Python, and several machine learning libraries  
* A sketchbook for taking notes and drawing ideas – bring every week, too! You’ll be asked to do regular drawings in preparation for assignments.  
* An assortment of drawing/writing implements for working on project ideas  
* Other art supplies (paper, etc) and printing as needed  

## LEARNING ACCOMMODATIONS  
The goal of this class is for everyone to succeed. Stevens and the VA&T program are dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The Office of Disability Services (ODS) works with undergraduate and graduate students with learning disabilities, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, psychiatric disorders, and other such disabilities in order to help students achieve their academic and personal potential. They facilitate equal access to the educational programs and opportunities offered at Stevens and coordinate reasonable accommodations for eligible students. These services are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy with support from the ODS staff. The ODS staff will facilitate the provision of accommodations on a case-by-case basis. 

If you have any questions about learning accommodations, please don’t hesitate to talk with me during or outside of class.

## PRONOUNS  
As this course includes lots of interaction between students, it’s important for us to create an environment of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronouns and chosen name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or pronouns, please inform me of the necessary changes. 
 
## INCLUSION STATEMENT  
Stevens and the VA&T program believe that diversity and inclusiveness are essential to excellence in academic discourse and creativity. In this class, the perspective of people of all races, ethnicities, gender expressions and gender identities, religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities will be respected and viewed as a resource and benefit throughout the semester. Suggestions to further diversify class materials and assignments are encouraged. If any course meetings conflict with your religious events, please do not hesitate to reach out to me to make alternative arrangements.
