# MASK  
**DUE: MONDAY, MARCH 30**  

> "Who sees the human face correctly: the photographer, the mirror, or the painter?" <br>– Picasso

For our next project, we'll use face tracking to create a digital mask that talks about your identity. Your task is to think about who you are – your personality, background, interests, and values – and create a digital mask that embodies those ideas. We'll research masks from a variety of cultures as well as contemporary artist's projects that use faces in their work.

The approach you take is up to you: your mask might be made of shapes drawn in Processing, a collage of images (or even videos!) on top of your face, typography, or some combination. You might cover portions of your face or reveal others. Your job is to think about not just a visually compelling project but one where your aesthetic decisions come together to tell a story about how you see and present yourself to the world.


## DELIVERABLES  
* Two drawings of your mask, 10 inspiration images (due March 23)  
* Screen recording of your mask sketch running (uploaded to Vimeo or YouTube)  
* Github repo with:  
	* Your code  
	* `README` file that includes:  
		* Brief description of your project and the imagery/decisions used  
		* Representative screenshot of your project  
		* Link to your screen recording    
		* Photographs or scans of your two ideation drawings  
	

## TIMELINE  
* **March 10:** Project assigned, demos, work on research and drawings, read *Shape of Content*  
* **March 17:** Spring break, no class!  
* **March 23:** How computers see faces, images as vectors, finish `Mask` project  
* **March 30:** Projects due, discussion of readings  


## CODE EXAMPLES  
For this project, we're using `P5.js`, a version of Processing that runs in Javascript. This means you can run your code in the browser and share it with friends! Offline examples are included in the `Code` folder (plus some extras that run in standard Processing), but we'll be doing everything in the online `P5.js` editor. The examples shown are here:  

* [Basic `P5.js` sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/jeffThompson/sketches/--VlWqSA)  
* [Loading images](https://editor.p5js.org/jeffThompson/sketches/tHkcqxNX)  
* [Face Tracking](https://editor.p5js.org/jeffThompson/sketches/cjkwkare) (the template you'll use for your mask)  

You can also check out this very helpful [Processing transition Wiki page](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Processing-transition).   


## FOR MONDAY, MARCH 23  
Over the next two weeks (next week is spring break!) you should be thinking about what you want your mask to tell us about your identity and what imagery best communicates those ideas. 

Take a look at the online collections from the [V&A](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?q=mask), [Smithsonian](https://www.si.edu/search?edan_q=mask&), and [Met](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search#!?q=mask) (or better yet go visit IRL!) and download/screenshot at least 10 masks you're inspired by. Carefully read the accompanying text: who made this object and why does it look the way it does?

After having done some research, start making drawings of what your mask might look like. You can do these digitally or using analog media, but each one should be at least `8.5x11"` and should show substantial time. Think about how the visual elements you want to include tell us something about your identity. Feel free to work on top of a photograph of your face and to use labels to explain your drawing ("this will be a looping video" or "covered in pine needles because I'm from Minnesota")

Finally, please read *Shape of Content*, a talk by painter Ben Shahn about the development of symbols in his work. You can find the PDF in this week's `Readings` folder. We'll discuss your drawings and the reading after break.

## RESOURCES  
* Lots of online face and emotion recognition tools, like [this one from Amazon](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition), [this one from Google](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/detecting-faces), and 
* Some excellent libraries (in addition to OpenCV's tools) including [OpenFace](https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface) and [JavaCV](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv)  
* Some of these references are a bit out of date, but [Daniel Shiffman's workshop Face It](https://github.com/shiffman/Face-It) has some great resources and examples  
* [Chernoff faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face) are an interesting model for data visualization involving faces  
* A lot of vision research points to our sight being driven by contrast, much like the edges in neural networks. For example, [this article on toad vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_detection_%28nervous_system%29#In_toad_vision), which links to [this crazy video](https://av.tib.eu/media/15148#t=0,00:25)  
* Do you see faces in random objects? It's a phenomenon called [pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia)  
* [Facial Action Coding System (FACS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_Action_Coding_System), a system to numerically encode facial expressions  
* Face recognition can be [tricked by invisible infrared light](https://boingboing.net/2018/03/26/the-threaten-from-infrared.html), making the computer think you're someone else
