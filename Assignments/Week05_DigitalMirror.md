# DIGITAL MIRROR

***PLEASE NOTE! This assignment and due dates will be updated later in the semester – check back when assigned for details***  

### DUE: FEBRUARY 15  

Adjustments to your selfie in Instagram, Photoshop filters, and even complex computer vision algorithms really just rely on reading and manipulating pixels in interesting ways. Over the next three weeks, we'll look at image processing both as a tool that will be useful later, but also as a creative way to transform images.

For this assignment, you'll create a "digital mirror" that takes input from a webcam and manipulates the image in some way. We'll install the resulting code in the hall so people can interact with your work!

Think about ways that you can use the pixel data coming in from the camera to make a new, interesting image. Do you want it to be recognizable? Can you chain together some of the ideas we looked at to make new effects, or design your own? What experience do you want viewers to have when looking at themselves?

Realtime processing can take a toll on your computer – to keep your output from getting laggy, try optimizing your code as much as possible. Things like copying image data and using the built-in `red()` function instead of the faster bit-fiddling version should be avoided.

### DELIVERABLES  
* Project sketches  
* Your finished *Digital Mirror* code  
* Video documentation of your mirror in action, uploaded to either YouTube or Vimeo  
* A repository of your code uploaded to Github  
* A `README` file in your repo, including:
  * A description of your project  
  * A screenshot of it running  
  * A link to your video  
* Upload a screenshot of your project to Canvas, and add a link to your repo as a comment

### FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 8  
For next week, I'd like you to start by drawing instead of coding. Please spend at least an hour making sketches of what your mirror might do – they can be rough and gestural, and include notes and arrows to indicate movement. This is about working through ideas quickly before starting into code, and getting over the hump of easy first ideas.

Then, once you are settled on an idea, start implementing it in code. For next week, you should have at least a rough version working so you can demo it to the class (even if you don't know how to do everything you want to do). Think of this as both iterating and refining the ideas from your sketches, and further sketching in code!

**Please also sign up for either a YouTube or Vimeo account (both are free). You'll be uploading video documentation of your finished projects there.**

### FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 15  
**PLEASE NOTE! Jeff will be out of town on the day the project is due. We won't meet as a class, but your project should be uploaded to Github and Canvas before 1pm that day. Please also check the next assignment, titled `Tracking`, for what will be due February 22.**

For next week, please finish your `Digital Mirror` project – see the `Deliverables` section above for exactly what to turn in. If you get stuck along the way, please pop into my office, or send me an email, and I'll do my best to help.

Please also install the OpenCV library for Processing. You can do this right inside the Processing app under `Sketch > Import Library > Add a Library...`. Search for `OpenCV for Processing` and install it. Try running one of the examples to make sure it works.

### PROJECTS SHOWN  

* [A history of the first webcam](https://youtu.be/a4PX8vksBFU), used to monitor an office coffee pot  
* Daniel Rozin's fabulous [*Wooden Mirror*](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/woodenmirror.html) project, and the fluffy [*PomPom Mirror*](http://www.bitforms.com/rozin/pompom-mirror)  
* [*Más Que La Cara*](https://medium.com/@zachlieberman/m%C3%A1s-que-la-cara-overview-48331a0202c0), an installation by YesYesNo  
* Jim Campbell's many [low-resolution video works](http://www.jimcampbell.tv/portfolio/low_resolution_works/) made with LEDs and other physical materials  
* A dump of in-process images for a project of mine that never turned into anything (found in the `Images` folder). It converts sections of the image into a grid of variously-sized checkerboards.
