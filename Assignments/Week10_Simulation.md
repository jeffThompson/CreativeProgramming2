# SIMULATION  
**DUE: MONDAY, APRIL 27**  

> "I think that my job is to observe people and the world" – Haruki Murakami  

> "You can observe a lot by just watching" – Yogi Berra  

For our last regular project of the semester, we'll turn to the natural world for inpsiration. The goal is to bridge research, observation, and the "real world" with code. You should first pick a natural system of some kind and observe it very carefully. From there, you'll create a project in Processing (either the Java version or P5JS) that is inspired by your system. The output doesn't need to mimic or precisely simulate your chosen subject, but can either be a careful a reproduction of that system or a work that is inspired by its details.

Some examples:  
* Observe the way snow falls in the breeze and ways snowflakes form; create a piece that generates a never-ending snowfall  
* Research flower parts; create a flower generator that includes dozens of options that mix-and-match from existing plants  
* Observe the way ants move and interact with each other; build a simulator that creates drawings you can save and print  

Other things to consider: shells, growth/decay, animal hide/fur patterns, weather, terrain, migration patterns, bacteria and viruses, etc etc etc! Go for a walk, watch some *Blue Planet*, observe your cat or even your own body – you're surrounded by amazing things that can inspire your project.

Overall, your goal should be to include as many tiny details as possible. Keep in mind though that full-on, accurate simulations can require years of research and deep knowledge of their domain plus tons of complex math: the definition of a simulation is "an approximate imitation" so embrace that! Don't feel like you have to create a perfect digital version. Instead, think of this as a mixture of careful research, meticulous observation, and creative making to make something new.

## FOR MONDAY, APRIL 13  
For next week, pick the natural system you'd like to research and observe. Reading will be useful, but equally important is looking. You should ideally be able to observe your system in real life but if you can't, watch videos on YouTube etc in the same way you would in person. Make notes, draw sketches of different parts – the goal is an understanding that goes beyond the superficial, allowing you later to translate these things into code.

You should also research your topic (Wikipedia and its "related articles" is a great place to start), taking careful notes on anything that seems interesting or helpful. Follow links in Wikipedia articles too – rabbit holes of knowledge are super productive for this kind of work.

When done, photograph all your sketches (if you're working analog) and put them into your notes file using Word, etc. Tidy everything up and arrange it so it feels cohesive, then save as a PDF and upload to Canvas.


## RESOURCES  
* Jason Webb's list of [Moprhogenic Resources]() is a great place to start (however, copying a known algorithm like reaction-diffusion isn't enough here!)  
* Daniel Shiffman's excellent online book [*The Nature of Code*](https://natureofcode.com/book/)  
* D'arcy Wentworth Thompson's amazing 1917 book [*On Growth and Form*](https://archive.org/details/ongrowthform1917thom)  


## PROJECTS SHOWN  
* Craig Reynolds' classic 1986 simulation program [*Boids*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids), which can create complex behavior with very simple rules  
* [Valentino Braitenberg's vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle), which use rules similar to Reynolds'  
* Simulation games like [*No Man's Sky*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLtmEjqzg7M), [*Sim City*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjxVci-fWj4), and the insanely-detailed [*Train Simulator*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ygMfRLjDag)  
* OpenAI's creepy [*Emergent Tool Use*](https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/) experiment
