FINAL PROJECT
====

### DUE: TUESDAY, MAY 8  

For your final project, your assignment is simple: make something visually and creatively exciting using code. The output form, visual style, content, and programming language are all completely up to you. During the next four weeks, we'll go through similar stages of development, much like we've done already: sketching and research, prototyping, and refinement. Your project should show a month's effort and should be an ambitious piece. But it should also be something you're personally excited about and want to spend time developing!

### TIMELINE  

* **Thurs, April 12:** Sketches due, demo on cluster computing and Amazon AWS, work day.  
* **Thurs, April 19:** Begin prototyping your project. **Jeff out of town, so use this as work time!** Please feel free to email work in progress for feedback/help, or we can schedule a Skype call that week.  
* **Thurs, April 26:** Work in progress crit, work day.
* **Fri, May 4**: Open work and help day – I'll be on campus and available to help all day with your projects!  
* **Tues, May 8 from 1-5pm**: Final critique in the VA&T Studio (not the room listed online!)  

### FOR THURS, APRIL 12  
For next week, alongside finishing your Faces project, please start ideating for this project. Rather than write a formal proposal at this stage, I'd like to you play, first in your sketchbook and then, if you have time, code.

Take at least an uninterrupted hour this week and draw in your sketchbook. Ideally, go somewhere specifically to do this like a coffee shop. Think about ideas, visual themes, and other artistic projects that you get inspired by (or better, obsessed with). The goal is not to mimic or modify something you've seen, but to pull together ideas that get your creative juices flowing. Draw as much as you can, even if they are hasty notations of an idea – don't worry if it's totally clear to others what the drawings are, its a way of thinking. When you come on something you're interested in, refine and/or iterate on it.

For a great take on what it means to iterate through ideas, see this [video with designer Aaron Draplin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOPA0NaeTBk).

**Please bring at least 20 pages (if your sketchbook is about half the size of a piece of typing paper, 10 if larger) of drawings to class next week.** We'll look at them together and start coding prototypes.

### FOR THURS, APRIL 19  
**Jeff will be out of town this week presenting a project, so we won't meet as a class!** Please start prototyping your project, with the goal of functional prototypes by next week. Just like our last project, fake what you need to and try to get the basic parts of your project implemented. If you get stuck or want feedback, I'm happy to help by email or Skype. Your projects should show substantial work for next week's in-progress crit.
