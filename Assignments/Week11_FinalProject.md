# FINAL PROJECT
**DUE: MAY 15 (not our exam time!)**  

**NOTE! Due to classes moving online and our due-dates changing, you have two options for your final project. Please read below and let me know if you have any questions!**

### OPTION 1: EXTEND YOUR SIMULATION PROJECT  
If you want, you can opt to extend your `Simulation` project and use that as your final project too. The `Simulation` assignment will still be due as usual, but you can think of that as a prototype, which you expand and refine of the final weeks of the class. If you go this route, you should still write a proposal.

### OPTION 2: SEPARATE FINAL PROJECT  
If you'd prefer, you can work on a separate final project – this would be the normal assignment if our schedule hadn't changed. For this project, your assignment is simple: make something visually and creatively exciting using code. The output form, visual style, content, and programming language are all completely up to you. During the next four weeks, we'll go through similar stages of development, much like we've done already: sketching and research, prototyping, and refinement. Your project should show a month's effort and should be an ambitious piece. But it should also be something you're personally excited about and want to spend time developing!

### TIMELINE  
* **April 13:** Final project assigned, work on ideation sketches, continue working on `Simulation` project  
* **April 20:** Finish `Simulation` project for next week, start prototyping your final project  
* **April 27:** `Simulation` projects due, continue developing your final project, calling into Zoom hours for help as needed  
* **May 4:** Continue working on project  
* **May 15 by 11:59pm:** Project documentation due online (see `Deliverables` below)  

### DELIVERABLES  
* Ideation sketches  
* Screenshot/photo of the finished project, uploaded to Canvas  
* Link to Github repo for your project  
* Video of your project running, posted as a link either in your repo or in Canvas  

### FOR MONDAY, APRIL 20  
For next week, you should continue working on your `Simulation` project (see that assignment for details) but also start ideating for this project. Take at least one uninterrupted hour and draw in your sketchbook, thinking through ideas. If you're working on a new piece, try to come up with as many ideas and variations as you can; if you're extending your `Simulation` project, use this as a chance to dig in really deep and think about what additional features you want to add.

Diagram out your ideas, make sketches, label things, add notes – the goal here is to get as much on paper as possible. Don't worry if an idea is bad... you're the only one that has to see it! You never know when one idea might trigger another, or that you come back later and realize there's something exciting there.

When you're done, take a photo of your top 2–3 ideas and upload them to Canvas. I'll take a look and get you some feedback – we can also talk on Zoom if you want to discuss more.

### FOR MONDAY, APRIL 27  
This week, you should be finishing your `Simulation` projects and, as time allows, working on your final project. We'll have a check-in next week, so think about questions or things you need help with.

### FOR MONDAY, MAY 4  
For next week, you should start working on your final project in earnest. **I'd like everyone to upload to Canvas a screenshot of your work in progress with a short description of where you're at with the project and what you have left to do.** I'll leave comments for everyone and we can do in-progress crits via Zoom if you want – please drop into my Zoom hours or send me a note.

Next week is our last "regular" class (though what is "regular" now anyway?) but I'll be available the week of May 11 for Zoom meetings too if you need help.
