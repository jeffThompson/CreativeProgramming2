# FINAL PROJECT
### DUE: MAY 16   

For your final project, your assignment is simple: make something visually and creatively exciting using code. The output form, visual style, content, and programming language are all completely up to you. During the next four weeks, we'll go through similar stages of development, much like we've done already: sketching and research, prototyping, and refinement. Your project should show a month's effort and should be an ambitious piece. But it should also be something you're personally excited about and want to spend time developing!

### TIMELINE  
* **April 15:** Final project assigned, work on sketches and code prototypes (and finish `Faces` project)  
* **April 22:** `Faces` project due, feedback session on final project, work day  
* **April 29:** Visit to Small Data Industries, keep working on project  
* **May 6:** In-progress feedback session, work day  
* **May 17 at 1pm:** Projects due, critique – meet in the VA&T Lab not where it lists online!  

### DELIVERABLES  
* Ideation sketches  
* In-progress work for critique  
* Screenshot/photo of the finished project, uploaded to Canvas  
* Link to Github repo for your project  
* Unless your project is physical (ie an installation or sculpture), a video of your project running, posted as a link either in your repo or in Canvas  

### FOR MONDAY, APRIL 22  
For next week, alongside finishing your `Faces` project, please start ideating for this project. Rather than write a formal proposal at this stage, I'd like to you play, first in your sketchbook and then in code.

Take at least an uninterrupted hour this week and draw in your sketchbook. Ideally, go somewhere specifically to do this like a coffee shop. Think about ideas, visual themes, and other artistic projects that you get inspired by (or better, obsessed with). The goal is not to mimic or modify something you've seen, but to pull together ideas that get your creative juices flowing. Draw as much as you can, even if they are hasty notations of an idea – don't worry if it's totally clear to others what the drawings are, its a way of thinking. When you come on something you're interested in, refine and/or iterate on it. For a great take on what it means to iterate through ideas, see this [video with designer Aaron Draplin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOPA0NaeTBk). 

Then in your computer, continue the sketching process in code. The goal should be both to explore what's possible but also to start implementing a rough version of your project.

### FOR MONDAY, APRIL 29  
Next week we'll take a visit to [Small Data Industries](http://smalldata.industries/), a company that helps conserve and preserve digital artworks. We'll leave the classroom right at 1pm so please be on time and ready to go! If you're running late you can meet us at the PATH station.

This next week you should continue working on project and have a working version of the project for next class. This should be a full iteration that we can discuss and refine, not just a rough sketch!
