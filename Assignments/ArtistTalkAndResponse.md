# ARTIST TALK AND RESPONSE

Each spring, the VA&T program hosts a lecture series, where artists, designers, and curators come to campus to give a public lecture on what they do. This is a great opportunity for you to hear about an artist's practice in detail, to see how people present their work in public, and to ask questions.

**This semester, you're required to attend at least one talk and write up a 1-paragraph response. You can attend additional talks and get 10-points extra credit on any assignment for each talk you attend.** If you cannot attend any talks due to work or another class at that time, please talk to me and we can find an alternative for you.

## SCHEDULE  
All talks are on Tuesdays from 5.30â€“6.30pm and meet in Babbio 104
