# ARTIST TALK AND RESPONSE

Each spring, the VA&T program hosts a lecture series, where artists, designers, and curators come to campus to give a public lecture on what they do. This is a great opportunity for you to hear about an artist's practice in detail, to see how people present their work in public, and to ask questions.

**This semester, you're required to attend at least one talk and write up a 1-paragraph response. You can attend additional talks and get 10-points extra credit on any assignment for each talk you attend.** If you cannot attend any talks due to work or another class at that time, please talk to me and we can find an alternative for you.

## SCHEDULE  
All talks are on Tuesdays from 5.30â€“6.30pm; they will meet in various locations so please look for posters around Morton.

* Feb 4: Laine Nooney (tech historian)  
* Feb 25: Jon Cohrs (filmmaker)  
* Mar 10: George Voss (designer)  
* Mar 24: Amy Khoshbin (multimedia artist)  
* April 14: Surya Mattu (creative coder)  

## RESPONSE  
For each talk you attend, please write up a 1-2 paragraph response and post it to Canvas. It should address:  

* A brief description of the person's work  
* 1-2 things you got really excited about  
* 1-2 things you weren't so sure of or had questions about  
* 1-2 ways this person's work or presentation made you think differently about your own work, professional goals, or way of making
