# FACES  
### DUE: THURSDAY, APRIL 12  

>"How can a computer be made to recognize a human face? This question remains unanswered, because pattern recognition by computer is still too crude to achieve automatic identification of objects as complex as faces." <br>– [Leon D. Harmon](https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA004159)

> "Who sees the human face correctly: the photographer, the mirror, or the painter?" <br>– Picasso

This project is about quick, wide-open exploration: make something about *faces*. Any language, any output format, any topic. The idea is for you to investigate an idea and make something that you're excited about. We'll be doing some tutorials on detecting faces and machine learning during this time, but your project doesn't need to engage any of those tools. Instead, think about an idea you can quickly prototype and explore. It might manifest as an interactive project, a printed image, sound, performance, etc. 

(We'll also look at projects related to machine learning and the arts throughout the next few weeks.)

### TIMELINE  
* **April 8:** Project assigned, face tracking with OpenCV, extracting features  
* **April 15:** Feedback session, work day, final project assigned, Face OSC  
* **April 22:** Project and final project proposal due, feedback session on final project ideas, work day  

### FOR MONDAY, APRIL 15  
For next week, start working on the project, keeping in mind the goal of exploration and quick prototyping! Try to explore an idea visually (how to make something that draws us in with color and form), conceptually (something whose idea is compelling and important), or poetically (an idea that resonates). For next week, you should be able to demo your idea with working code and talk about how it engages the idea of faces. We'll do a few demos and have work time.

### RESOURCES  
* Lots of online face and emotion recognition tools, like [this one from Amazon](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition), [this one from Google](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/detecting-faces), and 
* Some excellent libraries (in addition to OpenCV's tools) including [OpenFace](https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface) and [JavaCV](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv)  
* Some of these references are a bit out of date, but [Daniel Shiffman's workshop Face It](https://github.com/shiffman/Face-It) has some great resources and examples  
* [Chernoff faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face) are an interesting model for data visualization involving faces  
* A lot of vision research points to our sight being driven by contrast, much like the edges in neural networks. For example, [this article on toad vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_detection_%28nervous_system%29#In_toad_vision), which links to [this crazy video](https://av.tib.eu/media/15148#t=0,00:25)  
* Do you see faces in random objects? It's a phenomenon called [pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia)  
* [Facial Action Coding System (FACS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_Action_Coding_System), a system to numerically encode facial expressions  
* Face recognition can be [tricked by invisible infrared light](https://boingboing.net/2018/03/26/the-threaten-from-infrared.html), making the computer think you're someone else

* The super weird painting [*The Jurist*](https://www.giuseppe-arcimboldo.org/The-Jurist-1566.html) from 1566 by Guiseppe Arcimboldo, which shows a figure made out of raw chicken, fish, and a pile of books  
* Some examples from my own practice, using my blog as a digital sketchbook to record random experiments: [photo-merging eight faces in Photoshop](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2013/12/17/photomerged-faces/) and [degrading a photo of a face until OpenCV no longer recognizes it](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2012/05/22/no-longer-a-face/)

* And [another great list](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/AppropriatingNewTechnologies/wiki/Faces-in-Media-Art) from Kyle McDonald  

### NON-FACE MACHINE-LEARNING PROJECTS  
Some projects that aren't about faces, but use machine learning that we've looked at:

* Two great tutorials on Generative Adversarial Networks, one from [O'Reilly](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/oriole/saf-generative-adversarial-networks-for-beginners) and the other from [OpenAI](https://blog.openai.com/generative-models/)
