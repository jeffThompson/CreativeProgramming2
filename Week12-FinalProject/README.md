### ASSIGNMENT   
Our last project of the semester is meant to be a culmination of the two Creative Programming courses you've taken: make an art/design project that uses code, one that puts the technical and creative skills you've gained to work, that explores an idea or approach that you're excited about, and that is polished and (hopefully) ready for your portfolio. Think about the past projects we've done and the ways of working that resonate with you. This can be a client-driven piece, a poetic- or conceptually-focused fine art project, a tool, or somewhere in between or entirely different!

Think ambitiously about what you want to make and see in the world. What formats and processes excite you? What ideas or visuals do you want to explore? What do you want your audience to get from your work? What parts of writing and making with code do you find most rewarding? You're also encouraged to think about ways of getting out of the screen: prints, sculpture, performance, books/zines, etc!

You don't have to use `p5.js` for this, but I may not be able to help much if you use a tool I don't have experience with. Please chat with me early on if you want to work with another tool/language so we can talk about the ways I can support your project.

### FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 25  
For next week, as you finish up your games, please also think about what you'd like to do for your final project and write up a short ["elevator pitch."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) This should be a few sentences that include the following...

* What are you going to make – paint us a word picture!  
* 1–2 things that are inspiring this project (doesn't have to be art or even programming related)  
* 1 (or more) challenges you expect to need to figure out  

Please also pick out an image to show us while you pitch your project. This could be a screenshot of an early draft of your project, an image related to the ideas you'll be exploring, or something else fitting. We'll project them while you tell us about what you want to make!

No need to turn in anything on Canvas.
