    Email           jeff.thompson@stevens.edu
    Office/hours    Morton 208, Mondays 2–4pm

    Meeting times   Mondays 9.00am – 12.50pm
    Location        Visual Arts & Technology Studio

In this intermediate course, we’ll build on creative uses of computer programming, with a focus on tools and processes for making more technically, creatively, and conceptually complex projects. You’ll complete a series of assignments examining simulation, images, cameras, computer vision, and interactivity, as well as continue building a personal creative practice. Like in `Creative Programming 1`, we’ll also look at historical, contemporary, and theoretical issues around computation in the arts and our culture.

For information about homework, grades, etc, please see `CoursePolicies.md`.
