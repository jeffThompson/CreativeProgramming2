**Please note!** Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the second half of the class has been significantly revised and may change as we all adapt to covering this material online.

In this intermediate course, we’ll build on creative uses of computer programming, with a focus on tools and processes for making more technically, creatively, and conceptually complex projects. You’ll complete a series of assignments examining simulation, images, cameras, computer vision, and interactivity, as well as continue building a personal creative practice. Like in `Creative Programming 1`, we’ll also look at historical, contemporary, and theoretical issues around computation in the arts and our culture.

For information about homework, grades, etc, please see `CoursePolicies.md`.
