# MASK  

### TLDR  
* Due March 9  
* Create a mask that uses symbols to explore your identity  
* Use face tracking (and, optionally, skeleton, blob, or color tracking)  
* For February 23:  
  * Read *The Biography of a Painting* and *Introducing Myself*  
  * List 30 things your mask might show    
  * Pick at least three things from that list, come up with ways to add them to your mask  
  * Make a drawing of your mask, using annotations as needed  
  * Start experimenting with the code examples to see which you'd like to use for your project  
  * Upload your drawing to Canvas  
* For March 9:  
  * Finish project  
  * Create Github account and [download the desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) (we'll make repositories in class together)  
  * Upload the URL to your repo when finished

### ASSIGNMENT  

> "Who sees the human face correctly: the photographer, the mirror, or the painter?" <br>– Picasso

> "Do I contradict myself? / Very well then I contradict myself, / (I am large, I contain multitudes.)" <br> – [Walt Whitman](https://poets.org/poem/song-myself-51)  

For our next project, we'll use face tracking to create a digital mask that is a self-portrait. Overlaid in realtime using [`tensorflow.js`](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) and `p5.js`, your mask should talk about your identity while being a visually rich experience. You'll think about who you are and what things are core to your identity: your personality, background, interests, values, gender/sexuality, and/or anything else that you want to share.

The approach you take is up to you: your mask might be made of shapes drawn in code, a collage of images (or even videos!) on top of your face, typography, some combination, or another cool approach you come up with. Elements can be static or respond to your movements or even be interactive using your face (think: position, scale, angle, speed of motion, position onscreen, etc). You might cover portions of your face or reveal others. The goal here is to not just think about making a visually cool project but one where your aesthetic decisions come together to tell a story about how you see and present yourself to the world.

### FOR FEBRUARY 23  
This week, you should spend time thinking about what parts of your identity you want to show us and how you will do so. We are all complicated, made of many interconnected (and sometimes contradictory) parts. One of the beautiful things about art is that it can contain all those things!

Please start by reading *The Biography of a Painting* by Ben Shahn (1957) and *Introducing Myself* by Ursula Le Guin (1992). Both pieces talk about developing imagery, symbols, and ideas in ones' work.

To kick off your project, start by listing everything you can about yourself, aiming for at least 30 things. This can be related to your personality, background, interests, goals, flaws, fears... anything. **We won't share these lists with each other, so be frank and broad here – this list is for you.**

From this list, identify at least three things you want your mask to show (you will be asked to talk about these). For each item on this new list, write down:  

* 2–3 symbols or objects that represent that item to you  
* 2–3 ways you might show that part of yourself ***visually***  
* 2–3 ways that thing might move, change, or interact as your face moves  
* Where on your face this item belongs – this can add meaning too!  

With these lists in hand, make a drawing of what you want your mask to look like. You can work digitally or analog, or a mix! Feel free to start with a selfie and work on top of it, if that helps.

With this drawing, be as detailed as possible – this is a great way to think through your ideas before diving into code. Annotations like arrows, labels, etc can help explain your ideas. While this is a self-motivated project, you can think of this drawing as a pitch to a client! Try to get it as polished and clear as possible for an external audience.

When you're done, upload it to Canvas. If you have time, you can also start prototyping your mask in code.

***

### FOR MARCH 9  
For next week, please finish your project. Think about the feedback you received on your drawing and start writing code. You'll definitely come up with additional ideas as you work but, with a solid plan in place, the code should mostly be about realizing your vision and tweaking the appearance.

Please also create a Github account (if you don't already have one) and [download the Github Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/). We'll create repositories for this project together in class next week!

### RESOURCES  
* Writeup on [computer vision in art](http://www.flong.com/archive/texts/essays/essay_cvad/index.html) from Golan Levin  
* Webcams are great, but other cameras offer different forms of interaction:  
  * [Pixy2, a camera with built-in object detection](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14392)  
  * [OpenMV, another camera with computer vision capabilities](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14632)  
  * [An amazing guide to cameras for installations from Blair Neal](https://github.com/laserpilot/Guide_To_Cameras_Interactive_Installations)  
* Some lists of face-related projects and resources:  
  * [Prosthetic Knowledge](http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/tagged/face)  
  * [Another great list](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/AppropriatingNewTechnologies/wiki/Faces-in-Media-Art) from Kyle McDonald  
  * Some of these references are a bit out of date, but [Daniel Shiffman's workshop Face It](https://github.com/shiffman/Face-It) has some great resources and examples  
* Detailed article on [why dilation and erosion are helpful for computer vision](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/erosion_dilatation/erosion_dilatation.html)  
* A lot of vision research points to our sight being driven by contrast, much like the edges in neural networks. For example, [this article on toad vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_detection_%28nervous_system%29#In_toad_vision), which links to [this bananas video](https://av.tib.eu/media/15148#t=0,00:25)  
* Do you see faces in random objects? It's a phenomenon called [pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia)

### BIAS AND AI  
No tools are neutral, but AI and machine-learning are particularly frought: they are increasingly ubiquitous, are making decisions that impact people's lives, and are trained on data created by humans. AI, bias, and ethics is a massive conversation, but here are some articles that are a good starting point, especially as they relate to our project:

* [*Artificial Intelligence's White Guy Problem*](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligences-white-guy-problem.html) by Kate Crawford  
* [*Mathwashing, Facebook, and the Zeitgeist of Data Worship*](https://technical.ly/brooklyn/2016/06/08/fred-benenson-mathwashing-facebook-data-worship/), an interview with Fred Benenson  
* [*The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks*](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) by Andrej Karpathy  
* [*What a Machine Learning Tool that Turns Obama White Can (and Can't) Tell Us About AI Bias*](https://www.theverge.com/21298762/face-depixelizer-ai-machine-learning-tool-pulse-stylegan-obama-bias) by James Vincent  
* [A post on Twitter's auto-cropping algorithm](https://hackaday.com/2020/09/23/community-testing-suggests-bias-in-twitters-cropping-algorithm)
