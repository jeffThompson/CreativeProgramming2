MULTIPLE VIDEOS
Jeff Thompson | 2023 | jeffreythompson.org

Just like images and other assets, we can also
load more than one video file into our sketch.
For this example we load two videos and switch 
between them with the spacebar.

Note! p5.js doesn't give us a way to see if a
video is currently playing or not, so we need
a variable to keep track. This makes for some
messy if statements â€“ for more complicated 
projects, you might want to think about a better 
system for organzing this.
