### LISTEN TO YOUR SONG  
The first choice to make this week is what song to use. You might have listened to a perfect choice in class but you might also want some time to try some other songs and think about what will pair well with live visuals.

Listen to the song several more times: take notes, make drawings, close your eyes. Think about the deep listening exercise we did in class. What visual ideas do you hear? Is the song divided into sections (maybe chorus/verse, maybe larger divisions)? What do the instruments/sounds suggest in terms of visuals?

Revise your storyboard to reflect new ideas. Feel free to cut out the panels to re-order them, add new ones, etc. **Bring your storyboards to class next week!** You'll use them to help explain what you want to create.

### CREATE ROUGH VISUALS  
With your storyboard finished, get started on coding your visuals. This version can be rough but should give us an idea of what you want to create. If your project will have multiple scenes, focus on the one that will be most difficult to make.

> Your sketch should run fullscreen! Programming it that way from the start (using `width` and `height`) will help make sure everything runs nicely and will save you a lot of time later  

You'll also want to gather any assets you need for your project, such as video clips or materials for live camera manipulation.
