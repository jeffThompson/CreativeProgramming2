### ASSIGNMENT
> "Everything written symbols can say has already passed by. They are like tracks left by animals." â€“Â Kimura KyÅ«ho, 1768

Over the next two weeks, your assignment is to create a landing page for a brand's website, focusing on interactive typography. You'll need to think about stylistic choices in the context of a client-driven project and their brand (color, typefaces used, overall character) but are also encouraged to creatively/wildly experiment. Your choice of "brand" to work with is up to you: it can be a real company, one from film/TV/fiction, an organization, or a person.

We'll start with defining the project's visuals and create some code sketches that explore possible approaches. The goal here is to connect the brand's identity (which you are welcome to push into new territory) with the visuals you create and to practice the kind of ideation > presentation > refinement process that happens with client-based work. After a round of feedback on your sketches, you'll turn one of those ideas into a finished project.

### CODE EXAMPLES/VIDEOS
* Video tutorials for this week (coming soon)
* [Code examples in the `p5.js` Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/jeffThompson/collections/XPqAUU6EI)


### DELIVERABLES
* Project experimenting with interactive typography for a brand
* Automatically fill the width/height of the screen (use `screenWidth` and `screenHeigh` variables)
* At least three initial sketches in code, showing possible directions/variations
  * Upload a screenshot of each sketch to Canvas
* Finished project, ready to screen-share for critique
  * Upload three screenshots of the finished project to Canvas
* No need to include link to code for any part of this project


### STRETCH GOALS
* Have your sketch auto-resize if the window size is changed
* If you've done HTML/CSS before, you can add additional items to the page so you have something to scroll down to!
