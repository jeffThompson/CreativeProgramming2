### READ ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF ANNOYANCE  
To get inspired, please [read this short piece from NPR reporter Joe Palca](https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/history-and-civilisation/2019/12/why-do-we-get-annoyed-science-has-irritatingly-few-answers), who wrote an entire book about the science of being annoyed!

Want more? You can also read [this interview with Palca](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/11/annoying-science) by the American Psychological Association and [read the first chapter of the book](https://www.npr.org/2011/05/17/135703137/you-bug-me-now-science-explains-why) (scroll down to get to it).

### MAKE THE MOST ANNOYING THING  
Using `p5.js` and either the online editor or working locally, your task this week is to make the most absolutely annoying thing you possibly can. You're welcome to use visual elements, sound, interactivity, and/or anything else you can think of. That's it!

> NOTE! If you have sensitivity to flashing lights or other concerns, please let me know and we'll ask folks to avoid them in their projects

We will "enjoy" your projects together next week, then vote on which ones are the most annoying in a variety of categories :trophy:

### INSTALL VISUAL STUDIO CODE  
The online editor is a wonderful tool, but you've probably already bumped into its limitations. Working offline makes things faster, easier, and you can work in places with no internet! There are lots of ways to write Javascript offline, but for this next projects we'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's free, and will allow us to install some really helpful tools for writing `p5.js`.

Please [download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), then open it and make sure everything works. No need to install any extensions â€“ we'll do that together next week.
