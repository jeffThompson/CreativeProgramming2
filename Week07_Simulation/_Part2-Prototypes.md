# PART 2: PROJECT PROTOTYPE  

### TLDR  
* ⚠️ Due Thursday, April 15 by 11am EST ⚠️
* [Project prototype](#project-prototype)  
* No need to turn in anything this week, come with your prototypes ready to share with the class  

***

### Project prototype    
For next week, your goal should be a working prototype that can be rough around the edges but shows the basic functionality of your simulation. Think about the MVP document as a to-do list: what are the necessary parts your simulation needs to have in order to work?

Last week, we discussed the example snowfall simulator whose MVP document included the following, which can then be broken down into things we need to build:

* *Generate various snowflake shapes algorithmically*  
  * How to draw a snowflake shape in code? How complex should this be?  
  * What parameters should each snowflake have?  
  * How to structure this as a class?  
* *Create realistic falling motion*  
  * Look at your notes and see how snowflakes fall  
  * Use a speed vector to make the snowflake move  
  * Add rotation or "wiggle"  
* *Respawn snowflakes when they hit the bottom of the screen*  
  * Code to check position  
  * How to reset or remove/create snowflakes  
* *Wind changes the direction of snowfall*  
  * How should a "wind" variable be stored?  
  * How should it affect the snowflakes?  
  * Should we see anything visual to indicate the wind?  

It's ok if the elements aren't all working perfectly, but they should all be present so you can see how they interact, so we can give you helpful feedback, and so you can identify technical questions you need help with.

A few other things to consider:  
* If your MVP document has a list of "stretch goals," see how many of those you can get to as well (if it doesn't start keeping track of some!)  
* Avoid the temptation for [feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep) but definitely keep a list of things you think of as you're working that you'd like to add later  
* Similarly, keep a list of technical items you need help with  

When your prototype is ready, that's it! No need to turn in anything on Canvas this week, just come ready to share your work with the class.
