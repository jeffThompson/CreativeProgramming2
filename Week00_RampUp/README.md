# RAMP UP: HISTORICAL CODE RE-CREATIONS

### TLDR  
* Due January 26 at the start of class  
* Make a sketch that re-creates an early piece of code-based art
* Export as a `SVG` using [this template](https://editor.p5js.org/jeffThompson/sketches/KAPLMADjd)
* Laser print at along with a print of the original and bind into a zine (we'll do this in class)  
* Watch the [Vera Molnar interview](https://vimeo.com/273642211) and post a response to Canvas  

***

### ASSIGNMENT
This week's assignment is a way to get us started writing code again as well as connect with early practitioners in the field of creative computation. You should find a piece of code-generated artwork made prior to 1980 (see below for some artists/places to look) and make a re-creation of that piece using `p5.js`. We'll be printing these and binding them into zines, so if you pick an animation or interactive piece, have your sketch output a representative frame.

Think about this process as a mix between observational drawing, cosplay, and forensics: looking super carefully at every detail, trying to make the closest possible re-creation you can. Get really picky about things like size, composition, spacing, line thickness, margins, and color. There will be places where you have to make best-guess decisions. For pieces that involve randomness there's no need for your output to be identical to the original, but your code should generate a very similar result. Try to include comments in your code where you've had to make difficult decisions or to note things you figured out in the original.

> So, what is a code-generated artwork? In this case, it means a piece whose imagery was created using custom code. The final form of that work might be a film, a plotter drawing, etc but the primary tool for creating the piece should be code. If you find a piece you like and aren't sure, just send me a note.

Additionally, please watch [this interview with Vera Molnar](https://vimeo.com/273642211) from Studio International. It's about 40 minutes and is such a wonderful insight into the early history of our medium. Write up a one-paragraph (minimum) response and post it as a comment on your assignment on Canvas.

### DELIVERABLES
* Sketch that re-creates an early piece of code-based art  
* Export as a `SVG` (we'll print them in class next week along with the original piece)  
* Include a citation for the original piece in the comments at the top of your code (see the [template](https://editor.p5js.org/jeffThompson/sketches/KAPLMADjd) for more info)  
* 1-paragraph response to [Vera Molnar interview](https://vimeo.com/273642211), posted to Canvas (no need to turn in your code)

### SVG EXPORT  
Exporting images with `p5.js` is super easy, but raster formats are limited by their resolution. Vector formats, like `PDF` or `SVG`, allow for your work to be scaled up and down without any loss of quality! For this assignment, you'll be exporting your work in the [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) (`SVG`) format. In order to do so, however, you'll need to add a code library to your project.

We'll use Zeno Zeng's wonderful [`p5.js-svg`](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg) library for this. There is a simple example for setting this up in Zeng's Github repository, but I've set up a template for you too.

### RESOURCES
* [The ReCode Project](http://recodeproject.com), who inspired this assignment, has a website with lots of artworks from the 1970s, pulled from scans of the magazine *Computer Graphics and Art* (a PDF with all these can be found in this week's `Images` folder)
* [Rhizome's *compart* database](http://dada.compart-bremen.de/browse/artwork?filter_type=item_type&filter_value=drawing) – most of the images are pretty small, so this might be a good jumping-off point to search for a better version
* The V&A Museum in London has a great online collection – [this search should be a good starting point](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?listing_type=list&offset=0&limit=15&narrow=1&extrasearch=&q=computer+art&quality=0&objectnamesearch=&placesearch=&after=&before=1980&namesearch=&materialsearch=&mnsearch=&locationsearch=) though you'll want to confirm the piece you're looking at was made with code

### NOTE
This project is inspired by the [ReCode Project](http://recodeproject.com), a "community-driven effort to preserve computer art by translating it into a modern programming language." Their site includes an archive of new versions but please don't look at others' code before finishing your project, it spoils the fun!
