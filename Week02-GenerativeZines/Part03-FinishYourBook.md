### CREATE A COVER FOR YOUR BOOK  
During class and, if necessary, as part of your homework, create a cover for your zine. This might use a modified version of your code (be sure to save a copy!), new code based on the system you've built, or something new!

Your zine doesn't need a title or byline, if you don't want it. But think about how the cover ties in visually with your book's content (or is in contrast with it!) and how it can draw us in.

You may want to consider a different paper for your cover, especially a heavier weight but also a different color or texture than the interior. If your paper doesn't fold well, try using the creasing machine in the Fab Lab.

### PRINT AND BIND YOUR ZINE  
When everything is done, run the `PDF` export program we looked at in class. The `PREVIEW` file is meant to show you what your book will look like when it's finished. This is great for testing out the flow of the content and to see how spreads look together.

The `PRINT` file is what you should print at the Fab Lab. The pages will appear out of order in the `PDF`, but will be in the correct order once folded and bound.

> Note! This assumes you'll be doing a staple-bound or pamphlet stitch book! If you're planning to use the spiral or other binding method, you can combine your exported pages into a single `PDF` and print them as-is.

Bind your book, keeping in mind that craft and presentation are important! Wrapping your book in a sheet of paper to bring to class can help ensure everything stays nice and clean..

Optionally, print and bind a second copy of your zine to donate to the VA&T library!
