### CREATE A MOCKUP  
Last week, you starting building a system that can create varied output. Continuing this, your assignment this week is to further explore and refine your system's code, add text for at least some of the pages, and output a sequence of pages that can form your book.

The approach here may vary quite a bit! You might consider...  

* Save tons of versions, pick 8+ you like and arrange them manually  
* Create an arc through the book where variable(s) change across the pages (hint: use a for-loop and generate the pages using a function)  
* Iteratively output/refine the code, figuring out the sequence as you go  

There are a few other details to think about...  


* The number of pages in your book should be a multiple of four (one sheet of paper, folded in half, creates four pages)  
  * Your book should have at least 8 pages but can have more!  
* Aside from the first and last pages, everything else will be visible as two-page spreads, not singular images  
* Full-bleed (the image going to the edge) is possible but your book will need to be trimmed after binding  
* Cover paper? Binding style? Other materials?  

Once you have your pages and their order sorted out, print them **single sided** in the Fab Lab. Be sure you have DuckBills in your account and note the Fab Lab hours. If you need additional paper or other materials, be sure to get those for next week as well.

Nothing to turn in on Canvas, but bring your prints to class. Presentation and craft count towards your grade! No wrinkled or dirty prints please.
